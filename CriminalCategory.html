        <h1>Criminal cases</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
        The legal landscape of criminal cases in India is a dynamic tapestry woven by a comprehensive framework of statutes and regulations. These cases, which involve offenses against the state or society, are governed by the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The Indian judiciary, rooted in principles of fairness and justice, plays a pivotal role in adjudicating these matters and ensuring the due process of law.

Criminal cases encompass a broad spectrum of offenses, ranging from petty crimes to more serious transgressions, each carrying its own set of legal implications and penalties. The accused, presumed innocent until proven guilty, are afforded the right to a fair trial, legal representation, and protection against self-incrimination.

            <h2>Case 1</h2>
            <p>rushi Talwar and Hemraj Banjade are two names that shook India on 16th May, 2008. The then 14-year-old Arushi was murdered along with 45-year-old Hemraj and a lot of names appeared on the accused list. The case aroused a lot of public interest and received incredible amounts of media coverage.

                For the longest time, the nation kept on conjecturing who the murderer was: was it her father or her mother? Could it be the other two servants? We don’t know. What we now know is that the parents have been acquitted and as of now, no one really killed Arushi.

            <h2>Case 2</h2>
            <p>Back in September, a Class II student was found dead in the washroom of Gurgaon’s Ryan International School. The innocent kid, who apparently caused no harm to anyone was initially thought to have been killed over a sexual-assault situation, following which a bus conductor was arrested.

                However, just recently, a report has come out that claims a Class XI student killed him to postpone the exams. As the picture gets murkier, many are questioning how the bus conductor came into the picture in the first place? </p>

            <h2>Case 3</h2>
            <p>The gory death of Sheena Bora shocked the nation. Even more shocking was the arrest of her mother Indrani Mukerjea for deliberately plotting her murder. Mukerjea had never admitted to having two children and even claimed Sheena was her sister. The murder brought the spotlight onto the murky financial dealings of Indrani and her husband Peter Mukerjea.</p>
