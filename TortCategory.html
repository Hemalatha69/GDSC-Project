        <h1>Tort cases</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
        Tort cases involve civil wrongs where one party (the plaintiff) seeks compensation or damages from another party (the defendant) for harm or injury caused. Unlike criminal cases, tort cases are private disputes between individuals or entities and are meant to compensate the injured party rather than punish the wrongdoer.
        Tort law is a fundamental aspect of civil litigation, addressing a wide range of situations where one party's actions result in harm to another. It provides a mechanism for individuals to seek redress and compensation for injuries or losses caused by the wrongful conduct of others.

            <h2>Case 1</h2>
            <p>
                One of the landmark cases in the development of the law of negligence, Donoghue v. Stevenson set a precedent for the duty of care owed by manufacturers to consumers. In this case, May Donoghue consumed a ginger beer from a bottle that her friend purchased for her. Later, she discovered the remains of a decomposed snail in the bottle, which had not been visible at the time of purchase. Donoghue suffered gastroenteritis and sued the manufacturer, Stevenson. The House of Lords, in its judgment, established the concept of a "neighbor principle," stating that individuals must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions that could reasonably be foreseen to harm their neighbors. This case laid the foundation for the modern law of negligence, emphasizing the duty of care owed in the production and distribution of consumer goods.

            <h2>Case 2</h2>
            <p>
                Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co. is a notable case in the realm of tort law, specifically addressing the concept of proximate cause in negligence. In this case, Helen Palsgraf was waiting on a train platform when a package dislodged from a passenger's hands, causing fireworks inside it to explode. The explosion caused scales at the other end of the platform to fall on Palsgraf, resulting in injuries. Palsgraf sued the Long Island Railroad for negligence. The crucial question was whether the railroad owed a duty of care to Palsgraf. The court ruled that there was no duty owed, as the injury was not a foreseeable consequence of the railroad's actions. This case contributed significantly to the development of the legal concept of proximate cause, emphasizing that liability in negligence requires a reasonably foreseeable connection between the defendant's conduct and the plaintiff's injury.

            <h2>Case 3</h2>
            <p>
                Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants, commonly known as the "McDonald's hot coffee case," is a prominent product liability and personal injury lawsuit. Stella Liebeck spilled hot coffee on herself after purchasing it from a McDonald's drive-thru, resulting in severe burns. She sued McDonald's for negligence, arguing that the coffee was excessively hot and posed an unreasonable risk of harm. The jury awarded Liebeck compensatory and punitive damages. The case garnered widespread attention, sparking debates about personal responsibility and corporate liability. While criticized by some as an example of frivolous litigation, the case highlighted the importance of product safety, corporate responsibility, and the need for reasonable warning labels. It led to changes in the way companies approach product warnings and temperature standards, impacting the landscape of product liability law.
