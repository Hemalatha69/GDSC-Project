            Children's rights refer to the specific rights and protections afforded to children, typically individuals under the age of 18, to ensure their well-being, development, and safety. These rights are guided by the belief that children, as individuals with their own distinct needs and capacities, should be treated with dignity and afforded special protections within society. The concept of children's rights is widely recognized internationally and is enshrined in various legal instruments and conventions.

            Key aspects of children's rights include:<br>
            
             Right to Survival and Development: Children have the right to live and grow in an environment that supports their physical and mental well-being. This includes access to healthcare, nutrition, and a safe and nurturing living environment.<br>
            
            Right to Education: Children have the right to education that is directed towards the fullest development of their personality and potential. Governments are responsible for ensuring access to free and compulsory primary education and promoting higher education opportunities.<br>
            
            Protection from Exploitation: Children are entitled to protection from economic exploitation, hazardous labor, and any work that interferes with their education or is harmful to their health and development. Laws and regulations are established to prevent child labor and exploitation.<br>
            
            Protection from Abuse and Neglect: Children have the right to live free from all forms of abuse, neglect, and violence. Legal measures are in place to safeguard children from physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, as well as neglect.<br>
            
            Right to Play and Leisure: Children have the right to engage in play, recreational activities, and cultural life. Play is considered crucial for the development of creativity, social skills, and overall well-being.<br>
            
            Right to Identity: Children have the right to know and be cared for by their parents, whenever possible. They also have the right to a name, nationality, and, as far as possible, to know and be cared for by their parents.<br>
            
            Freedom of Expression: Children have the right to freely express their opinions and to have their views taken into account on matters that affect them, according to their evolving capacities.<br>
            
            Right to Participation: Children have the right to participate in decisions that affect them. This includes the right to express their views in matters concerning their welfare, and these views should be given due weight according to the child's age and maturity.<br>
            
            The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is a widely recognized international treaty that outlines the comprehensive rights of children. Governments, non-governmental organizations, and advocates work together to promote and protect the rights of children globally, with the aim of ensuring their healthy development and a secure, supportive environment.<br>
