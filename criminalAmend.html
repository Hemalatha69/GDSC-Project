    <p>
        The legal landscape of criminal cases in India is a dynamic tapestry woven by a comprehensive framework of statutes and regulations. These cases, which involve offenses against the state or society, are governed by the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The Indian judiciary, rooted in principles of fairness and justice, plays a pivotal role in adjudicating these matters and ensuring the due process of law.

Criminal cases encompass a broad spectrum of offenses, ranging from petty crimes to more serious transgressions, each carrying its own set of legal implications and penalties. The accused, presumed innocent until proven guilty, are afforded the right to a fair trial, legal representation, and protection against self-incrimination.
