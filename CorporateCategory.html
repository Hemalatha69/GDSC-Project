            <h2>Case 1</h2>
            <p>
                The Satyam Scandal, one of India's most notorious corporate fraud cases, unfolded in 2009 when Satyam Computer Services' founder and chairman, Ramalinga Raju, confessed to orchestrating a massive financial fraud. Raju admitted to inflating the company's profits and fabricating assets, revealing a staggering discrepancy in the financial statements. The revelation shocked investors, employees, and the global business community. In the aftermath, the government took swift action, appointing new leadership and facilitating the company's acquisition by Tech Mahindra. The case underscored the importance of transparency, corporate governance, and the need for robust regulatory mechanisms in India's corporate sector.

            <h2>Case 2</h2>
            <p>
                The Vodafone Tax Dispute centered around the tax implications of Vodafone's acquisition of Hutchison Essar in 2007. The Indian government sought to tax Vodafone for the transaction, claiming that it fell within the country's jurisdiction. Vodafone contested this, arguing that the deal occurred offshore and was not subject to Indian taxation. The dispute reached the Supreme Court of India, which, in a landmark decision, ruled in favor of Vodafone, stating that the Indian tax authorities did not have jurisdiction over the transaction. The case had far-reaching implications for foreign investors and highlighted the need for clarity in tax laws to foster a favorable investment climate.

            <h2>Case 3</h2>
            <p>
                The Nirav Modi Punjab National Bank (PNB) Fraud came to light in 2018 when it was revealed that jeweler Nirav Modi and his companies had defrauded PNB through fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoUs). Modi and his associates had exploited loopholoopholes in the banking system to secure credit from overseas branches of Indian banks. The scam amounted to nearly $2 billion, making it one of the largest banking frauds in India. The case exposed vulnerabilities in the banking sector and led to heightened scrutiny of banking practices and regulatory oversight. It also spurred discussions on strengthening risk management and fraud prevention measures within financial institutions. The subsequent investigation and legal proceedings underscored the importance of robust internal controls and the need for vigilance against financial misconduct in the corporate sector.
