          <h2>Shah Bano Case (1985)  </h2>
          <p>The Shah Bano case is significant in the context of family law in India. Shah Bano, a Muslim woman, 
             sought maintenance from her husband after their divorce under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). 
             The Supreme Court ruled in her favor, granting her the right to maintenance.
            The case sparked debates on the rights of Muslim women and led to the passage of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act,
             1986, which limited the amount of maintenance a divorced Muslim woman could claim.</p>
