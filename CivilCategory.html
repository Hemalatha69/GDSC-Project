        <h1>Civil cases</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
        Civil cases are legal disputes between individuals, organizations, or entities that typically involve private rights, obligations, or property. In a civil case, one party (the plaintiff) files a lawsuit against another party (the defendant) seeking a legal remedy, usually in the form of monetary compensation or equitable relief. Civil cases can cover a broad range of issues, including contracts, property disputes, personal injury claims, family law matters (such as divorce and child custody), and more.
        Civil cases play a crucial role in maintaining social order and justice by providing a legal framework for individuals to seek redress for harm or wrongdoing. The outcomes of civil cases can have a significant impact on the lives, rights, and responsibilities of the parties involved.

            <h2>Case 1</h2>
            <p>In this landmark judgment, the Apex Court allowed a petition on behalf of the country’s transgender community and held that the right to express one’s identity in a non-binary gender was an essential part of freedom of expression. It directed the government to give legal recognition to the third gender, such that individuals would be able to identify themselves as male, female or third gender. While referring to Article 14 of the Constitution of India which states that “ the state shall not deny to ‘any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India,” it held that the article affords protection to ‘any person,’ and “transgender persons who are neither male/female fall within the expression ‘person’ and, hence, entitled to legal protection of laws in all spheres of State activity, including employment, healthcare, education as well as equal civil and citizenship right.”.</p>

            <h2>Case 2</h2>
            <p>Almost exactly 40 years ago, in March 1979, Kapila Hingorani made history by filing the PIL and securing the release of nearly 40,000 undertrials languishing in the jails of Bihar’s Patna and Muzzafarpur, in the ‘Hussainara Khatoon’ case. The Hussainara Khatoon case established a new paradigm in the Indian justice system, which until 1979 was accessible to only those personally affected by the law or facing penal action. The court allowed Hingorani to pursue a case in which she had no personal locus standi (the right or capacity to bring an action or to appear in a court) making Public Interest Litigations (PILs) a permanent fixture in Indian jurisprudence. Ever since PILs have become the champion of the underprivileged and those wronged by the system.</p>

            <h2>Case 3</h2>
            <p>In this case, the court applied the principle of ‘Polluter Pays’ for the first time. This principle demands that “the financial costs of preventing or remedying damage caused by pollution should lie with the undertakings which cause pollution or produce the goods which cause pollution.” The Supreme Court also relied on the judgment given in the case of M. C. Mehta v. Union of India, which is responsible for the inclusion and evolution of the rule of absolute liability in India. This rule states that “if any person is engaged in any inherently dangerous or hazardous activity, and if any harm is caused to any person during the carrying out of such hazardous activity, then the person who is carrying out such activity will be absolutely liable and cannot plead defense”.</p>
