            <h2>Shayara Bano vs. Union of India (Triple Talaq Case, 2017)  </h2>
            <p>Shayara Bano, a Muslim woman, petitioned the Supreme Court of India challenging the practice of "triple talaq," a form of instant divorce in Islamic law.
                 The court declared the practice unconstitutional, violating the rights of Muslim women.
                The judgment led to the passage of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalizing the practice of 
                triple talaq and providing legal protection to Muslim women against instant and arbitrary divorces.</p>

            <h2>Githa Hariharan vs. Reserve Bank of India (1989) </h2>
            <p>In this landmark case, the Supreme Court dealt with the issue of the custody of a minor child in the context of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act.
                 The court held that the welfare of the child is of paramount importance in deciding custody matters and that the mother is not automatically the guardian after a certain age of the child.</p>

            <h2>Indra Sarma vs. V.K.V. Sarma (2013) </h2>
            <p>This case dealt with the issue of maintenance under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The Supreme Court clarified that a wife is entitled to maintenance even 
                if she is earning, and the husband cannot evade the responsibility of providing financial support to his wife. The judgment emphasized the objective of preventing destitution and 
                recognized the right of a wife to lead a life in accordance with the social status and dignity expected of her.</p>
